      <h1>Hello, welcome to my blog!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my blog! I am not a real blogger. Everything in all of my blogs is faked.
         Instead of going out into the world and sharing my experiences, I will be sharing 
         pretend experiences that I wish I could experience, but I am too busy learning how 
         to create web applications. Nonetheless, please follow my page... if that function 
         ever gets programmed in. 
      </p>
      <p>Today I continue to write BS blog entries and... actually, this entry is written 
        seconds after the first post of the blog. I am just tasked to enter multiple blog 
        entries so I can work to make them display nicely together. I have nothing else to 
        share. Sorry!
      </p>
